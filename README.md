# Introduction

### Setting and Lore

Tritium Core takes place after the collapse; after the invasion; after first contact...

Parts of society still tick along despite the conflict with the Russians. In the western cities far from the eastern front. The American government make themselves sparse, operating from a secret location they command troops and console citizens over the air waves. Industry produces what they can and ship it east although war time production is severely hampered. Feral gangs operate in the easter regions, lording over the small settlements that remain. Civilian militia groups operate here and regularly engage enemy troops, along with government soldiers. It's a land of fighting, espionage, tradition and guerilla warfare now. Just before the invasion the USD's priced soared such that most transactions were made with change as in the 1800's.
