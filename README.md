> _**“Listen to me, this place is under no obligation to make sense to you. Got it? Good. Now get the fuck out.”**_

Parts of society still tick along despite the conflict with the Russians. In the western cities far from the eastern front. The remnant of the federal government makes themselves sparse, operating from a secret location commanding troops and consoling citizens over the air waves. Industry produces what they can and ship it east although, war time production is severely hampered. Feral gangs and religious cults operate in the eastern regions, often lording over the small settlements that remain. Civilian militia groups operate here and regularly engage enemy troops, along with government soldiers.&#x20;
