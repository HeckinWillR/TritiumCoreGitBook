### Setting and Lore: A Narrative Primer

> _**“Listen to me, this place is under no obligation to make sense to you. Got it? Good. Now get the fuck out.”**_



Tritium Core is set in a late 1970's, retro-themed alternate America. Some years after a catastrophic invasion by the Russians. Nearly quelled, the invaders managed to push into the interior united stated along the interstate corridors dividing the land and make the transport of products in any direction an off-road endeavor. At the height of the initial attack landing in the Chesapeake Bay, POTUS was extracted from his residence in D.C. by an elite unit of Viper Co. Ltd. An infamous American private military company. Who escorted him without federal direction to an undisclosed location, presumably in the Appalachian Mountains.

In the western cities far from the eastern front, parts of society still tick along despite the ongoing conflict with the Russians. The remnants of the federal government make themselves sparse, operating from a secret location commanding troop movements and occasionally consoling citizens over the air waves. The battlefield is everywhere involving small, allied nations units, UN-AMM, American and foreign PMCs, civilian militia groups and long defunct federal agencies doing what they can - with the resources they have left. Feral gangs and disturbing religious cults operate in the eastern regions, left unchecked. Often lording over the small settlements that remain.&#x20;

Industry produces what they can and ship it east although, war time production is severely hampered. Currency still flows but things have changes. In the east the paper dollar is considered useless. Alloy coins are the primary currency, and commodities have rebalanced back to 19th century prices. Many merchants see a new gold rush buying in the east and selling in the west. And many die. New trade routes opened up through rural America as interstates and major roadways are desperately avoided.
